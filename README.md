## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

### Flutter
Flappy Doggo is built using **Flutter**, Google's open-source UI framework for creating natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter enables:
- **High-Performance Rendering**: Smooth animations and graphics using Skia.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Consistent experience across Android and iOS (iOS support planned).
- **Rich Widget Library**: Material Design components for a polished UI.
- **Hot Reload**: Rapid development and testing for faster iterations.

### Potential Flame Engine Integration
While Flappy Doggo currently uses custom Flutter rendering with `CustomPainter`, the **Flame game engine** (a 2D game framework built on Flutter) could enhance future development. Flame offers:
- **Game Loop Management**: Simplified handling of updates and rendering.
- **Sprite and Animation Support**: Streamlined asset management for characters and backgrounds.
- **Collision Detection**: Built-in tools for efficient collision handling.
- **Physics Simulation**: Easy integration of gravity and movement mechanics.

To integrate Flame, consider using components like `SpriteComponent` for the dog and buildings, and leverage Flame's game loop for smoother updates. The current implementation achieves similar results with custom logic but could benefit from Flame's optimizations.

### Other Technologies
- **Dart**: The programming language powering Flutter, ensuring fast execution and a clean codebase.
- **Shared Preferences**: For persistent storage of player names and leaderboard data.
- **Audioplayers**: For seamless playback of background music and sound effects.
- **Custom Painters**: For rendering the game canvas, including the dog, buildings, and background.

## üé® Customization

Personalize Flappy Doggo by modifying the following:

- **Assets**:
  - Replace images in `assets/images` (e.g., `bird-normal.png`, `bg-normal.png`).
  - Add custom sound effects in `assets/sounds` (e.g., `jump.wav`, `score.wav`).
- **Game Parameters** (in `lib/main.dart`):
  - Gravity: `gravity = 0.45`
  - Jump force: `jumpForce = -9`
  - Game speed: `gameSpeed = 4.0`
  - Building spawn distance: `buildingSpawnDistance = 950`
- **Flame Integration**: To enhance the game, consider adding the Flame package (`flame: ^1.8.0`) to `pubspec.yaml` and refactoring the game loop and rendering to use Flame components.

## üêõ Known Issues

- **Touch Sensitivity**: Controls may feel overly sensitive on some devices.
- **Local Storage**: Scores and player data are stored locally and may be cleared with app data.
- **Performance**: Older devices may experience minor frame rate drops.
